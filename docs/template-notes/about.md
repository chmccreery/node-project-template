# About

<!-- 
This page can be removed when making a new project from this one, but the documentation section of README.md and the docs directory would be good to keep.
-->

This is a template project for new JavaScript projects, whether making a frontend app, server-side app or CLI tool.

## Purpose

Why does this project exist? I'm tired of running `git init` and `npm init` and starting with an empty repo each time.  I know mostly what my git configs, `package.json` details and docs will look like and I don't want to have to type from memory or copy and paste - I want to get to the core code.

So now I just use this repo as a starting point and reference, to make new projects faster to setup and also to keep them consistent.

This project is deliberately open-ended so you can make choices about your own NPM commands and test framework. The only dependency here is _ESLint_.
